## Overview

NativePHP Mobile provides a streamlined development workflow that lets you build, test, and iterate on your mobile apps quickly. The development cycle revolves around the `native:run` command, which builds your app and deploys it to emulators or physical devices.

## Development Cycle

The typical development workflow follows this pattern:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write Code">
    Make changes to your Laravel application code, views, or assets.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the App">
    Use `php artisan native:run` to build and launch your app on a device or emulator.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Changes">
    Interact with your app on the device to verify functionality.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Iterate">
    Return to step 1 and repeat. Use the `--watch` flag for automatic hot reloading.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running Your App

### Basic Usage

The `native:run` command builds and runs your app on iOS or Android:

```bash
# Interactive platform selection (macOS only)
php artisan native:run

# Run on Android
php artisan native:run android
php artisan native:run --android

# Run on iOS (macOS only)
php artisan native:run ios
php artisan native:run --ios
```

You can use shorthand notation:

```bash
# Shorthand for Android
php artisan native:run a

# Shorthand for iOS
php artisan native:run i
```

### Build Types

Choose between debug and release builds:

```bash
# Debug build (default)
php artisan native:run android --build=debug

# Release build
php artisan native:run android --build=release

# Android App Bundle
php artisan native:run android --build=bundle
```

**Build Types:**
- **Debug**: Fast builds with debugging enabled, ideal for development
- **Release**: Optimized builds for production testing
- **Bundle**: Android App Bundle format (AAB) for Play Store distribution

### Device Selection

When running in debug mode, you'll be prompted to select a target device:

```bash
# Let the CLI prompt you
php artisan native:run android

# Specify a device UDID directly
php artisan native:run android emulator-5554
```

The command will automatically:
- Detect connected physical devices
- List available emulators
- Launch an emulator if none are running

### Custom Start URL

Launch your app at a specific route:

```bash
php artisan native:run android --start-url=/dashboard
```

This updates `NATIVEPHP_START_URL` in your `.env` file and loads that path when the app starts.

## Hot Reload Development

Enable hot reload to automatically sync changes to your running app:

```bash
php artisan native:run android --watch
php artisan native:run android -W
```

With hot reload enabled:
- File changes are detected automatically
- Updates are pushed to the running app via WebSocket
- No need to rebuild and reinstall

<Note>
Hot reload requires Watchman to be installed on your system. See the [Hot Reload documentation](/build/hot-reload) for setup instructions.
</Note>

## Emulator vs Device Testing

### Emulators/Simulators

**Pros:**
- Fast to launch and test
- Easy to test multiple device sizes
- No physical hardware required
- Debugging tools readily available

**Cons:**
- May not accurately represent device performance
- Some hardware features unavailable (camera, GPS, NFC)
- Graphics performance differs from real devices

**When to use:** Rapid development, UI testing, general functionality testing

### Physical Devices

**Pros:**
- True performance characteristics
- Access to all hardware features
- Real-world network conditions
- Accurate touch and gesture testing

**Cons:**
- Requires device setup and connection
- May be slower for rapid iteration
- Limited to devices you own

**When to use:** Performance testing, hardware feature testing, final QA

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use emulators for rapid development">
    Emulators are ideal for quick iterations during active development. They launch faster and don't require device connectivity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test on real devices regularly">
    Run your app on physical devices at least once per major feature to catch performance issues and hardware-specific bugs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test on multiple device sizes">
    Use emulators to quickly test different screen sizes and resolutions, especially for responsive layouts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test platform-specific features on real hardware">
    Features like push notifications, NFC, biometrics, and camera work best when tested on physical devices.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Build Logs

Build logs are automatically saved to help diagnose issues:

```bash
# Android build log
nativephp/android-build.log

# iOS build log
nativephp/ios-build.log
```

Use verbose output for detailed build information:

```bash
php artisan native:run android -v
```

## Platform-Specific Requirements

### Android

**Required:**
- Android SDK installed
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) in PATH
- At least one emulator or connected device

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
NATIVEPHP_ANDROID_SDK_LOCATION=/path/to/android/sdk
```

### iOS (macOS only)

**Required:**
- Xcode installed
- iOS Simulator or physical device
- Development team configured in `nativephp.php`

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
NATIVEPHP_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=TEAM_ID_HERE
```

## Troubleshooting

### App ID Not Set

```
NATIVEPHP_APP_ID is not set.
```

**Solution:** Add `NATIVEPHP_APP_ID` to your `.env` file:

```bash
NATIVEPHP_APP_ID=com.example.myapp
```

### No Devices Found

```
No connected Android devices or emulators found.
```

**Solution:** 
- Ensure ADB is running: `adb devices`
- Launch an emulator from Android Studio
- Connect a physical device via USB with debugging enabled

### WSL Not Supported (Android)

```
Android is not supported in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
```

**Solution:** Run the command from Windows CMD or PowerShell, not from WSL.

### Build Failed

Check the build log for detailed error information:

```bash
# Android
cat nativephp/android-build.log

# iOS
cat nativephp/ios-build.log
```

Run with verbose output for more details:

```bash
php artisan native:run android -v
```

## Non-Interactive Environments

For CI/CD pipelines, disable TTY mode:

```bash
php artisan native:run android --no-tty
```

This prevents interactive prompts and is suitable for automated builds.
