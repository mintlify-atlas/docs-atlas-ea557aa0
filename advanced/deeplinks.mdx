title: Deep Links & URL Schemes
description: Open your app from URLs, handle deep links, and integrate with NFC tags
---

Deep linking allows your NativePHP Mobile app to open from URLs, whether from web browsers, other apps, or NFC tags. Configure custom URL schemes and associate verified HTTPS domains.

## Configuration

Deep links are configured in `config/nativephp.php`:

```php
'deeplink_scheme' => env('NATIVEPHP_DEEPLINK_SCHEME'),
'deeplink_host' => env('NATIVEPHP_DEEPLINK_HOST'),
```

Set these values in your `.env` file:

```bash
NATIVEPHP_DEEPLINK_SCHEME=myapp
NATIVEPHP_DEEPLINK_HOST=example.com
```

### Applying Changes

After configuring deep links, rebuild the native configuration:

```bash
php artisan native:install --force
php artisan native:run
```

## URL Scheme Deep Links

URL scheme deep links use a custom protocol to open your app:

```
myapp://path/to/page?param=value
```

### Choosing a URL Scheme

Your URL scheme should be:
- **Unique**: Avoid conflicts with other apps
- **Lowercase**: Use only lowercase letters
- **Memorable**: Easy for users to recognize
- **Branded**: Related to your app or company name

**Good examples:**
- `nativephp://`
- `mystore://`
- `acmecorp://`

**Avoid:**
- Common words (`app://`, `open://`)
- Generic terms (`link://`, `mobile://`)
- Existing schemes (`http://`, `mailto://`)

### Configuring URL Scheme

```bash
# .env
NATIVEPHP_DEEPLINK_SCHEME=myapp
```

This allows URLs like:
- `myapp://home`
- `myapp://products/123`
- `myapp://settings?tab=account`

### Testing URL Schemes

**iOS:**
```bash
xcrun simctl openurl booted myapp://home
```

**Android:**
```bash
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "myapp://home"
```

**From a web page:**
```html
<a href="myapp://products/123">Open in App</a>
```

## HTTPS Deep Links (Universal Links)

HTTPS deep links allow regular web URLs to open your app when tapped:

```
https://example.com/products/123
```

If the app is installed, the link opens the app. If not, it opens in the browser.

### Configuring HTTPS Deep Links

```bash
# .env
NATIVEPHP_DEEPLINK_HOST=example.com
```

This allows URLs like:
- `https://example.com/home`
- `https://example.com/products/123`
- `https://example.com/settings?tab=account`

### Platform Requirements

#### iOS (Universal Links)

iOS Universal Links require hosting an `apple-app-site-association` file on your domain:

**File location:**
```
https://example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
```

**File content:**
```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "TEAM_ID.com.example.app",
        "paths": ["*"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace:
- `TEAM_ID` with your Apple Developer Team ID
- `com.example.app` with your app's bundle identifier
- `["*"]` with specific paths if you don't want all URLs to open the app

**Requirements:**
- File must be served over HTTPS
- Content-Type must be `application/json`
- No redirects allowed
- File must be accessible without authentication

#### Android (App Links)

Android App Links require hosting a `assetlinks.json` file:

**File location:**
```
https://example.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

**File content:**
```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.example.app",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        "YOUR_CERTIFICATE_FINGERPRINT"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

Replace:
- `com.example.app` with your app's package name
- `YOUR_CERTIFICATE_FINGERPRINT` with your app signing certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint

**Getting your certificate fingerprint:**
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore
```

**Requirements:**
- File must be served over HTTPS
- Content-Type must be `application/json`
- File must be accessible without authentication

<Warning>
HTTPS deep links only work when both the domain verification file is correctly configured AND the app is installed from the App Store/Play Store or signed with a release certificate.
</Warning>

## Handling Deep Links in Your App

When a deep link opens your app, NativePHP dispatches it as a Laravel route.

### Defining Deep Link Routes

Handle deep links in your `routes/web.php` or `routes/native.php`:

```php
// routes/web.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

// Handle: myapp://home or https://example.com/home
Route::get('/home', function () {
    return view('home');
});

// Handle: myapp://products/123 or https://example.com/products/123
Route::get('/products/{id}', function ($id) {
    return view('product', ['id' => $id]);
});

// Handle: myapp://settings?tab=account
Route::get('/settings', function (Request $request) {
    $tab = $request->query('tab', 'general');
    return view('settings', ['tab' => $tab]);
});
```

### Detecting Deep Link Launches

Deep links are handled through Laravel's routing system. When a user taps a deep link, your app opens and Laravel routes the request to the appropriate controller or page.

### Handling Deep Links with Routes

Define routes that match your deep link structure:

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::get('/products/{id}', function ($id) {
    return view('product', ['id' => $id]);
})->name('product');

Route::get('/checkout', function () {
    return view('checkout');
})->name('checkout');
```

### Livewire Deep Link Handling

Handle deep link parameters in Livewire components:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

class ProductPage extends Component
{
    public $productId;

    public function mount($id)
    {
        $this->productId = $id;
        // Load product details based on the ID from the deep link
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.product-page');
    }
}
```

### Redirecting After Deep Link

Redirect to a specific page when a deep link is received:

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::get('/products/{id}', function ($id) {
    // Redirect to the product page
    return redirect()->route('product', ['id' => $id]);
});
```

## NFC Tag Integration

<Note>
NFC functionality is not currently provided as a built-in facade in NativePHP Mobile. You can implement NFC support using custom plugins.
</Note>

NFC tags can store URLs that, when tapped, open your app through deep links.

### NFC Deep Link Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="User taps NFC tag">
    Device reads the URL from the NFC tag (e.g., `https://example.com/products/123`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="System checks for app association">
    Operating system checks if your app is associated with the domain
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="App opens">
    Your app opens and Laravel routes the request to `/products/123`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Route handler processes request">
    Your route or controller loads the product and displays it
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setting Up NFC Tags

To enable NFC deep links:

1. Write your app's deep link URL to an NFC tag using an NFC writing app
2. Ensure the URL matches your configured `deeplink_host` 
3. Configure proper domain verification files (see HTTPS Deep Links section above)

When users tap the NFC tag, the URL will open your app if it's installed, or open in a browser otherwise.

### NFC Tag Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS URLs for NFC tags">
    HTTPS URLs work both when the app is installed and when it's not (falling back to browser).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep URLs short">
    NFC tags have limited storage. Use short, clean URLs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test NFC tags on both platforms">
    iOS and Android handle NFC differently. Test your tags on both platforms.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide fallback content">
    Ensure the URL works in a browser for users who don't have the app installed.
  </Accordion>

## Advanced Deep Link Patterns

### Parameter Extraction

Extract parameters from deep link URLs:

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::get('/share/{type}/{id}', function ($type, $id) {
    // Handle: myapp://share/product/123
    // Handle: myapp://share/post/456
    return view('share', ['type' => $type, 'id' => $id]);
});
```

### Query Parameters

Handle query parameters in deep links:

```php
Route::get('/search', function (Request $request) {
    // Handle: myapp://search?q=laptop&category=electronics
    $query = $request->query('q');
    $category = $request->query('category');
    
    return view('search', [
        'query' => $query,
        'category' => $category,
    ]);
});
```

### Authentication Gates

Protect deep link routes with authentication:

```php
Route::get('/account/orders/{id}', function ($id) {
    // Handle: myapp://account/orders/123
    // Redirects to login if not authenticated
    return view('order', ['id' => $id]);
})->middleware('auth');
```

### Dynamic Deep Link Generation

Generate deep links programmatically:

```php
// Generate a URL scheme deep link
$scheme = config('nativephp.deeplink_scheme');
$deepLink = "{$scheme}://products/123";

// Generate an HTTPS deep link
$host = config('nativephp.deeplink_host');
$httpsLink = "https://{$host}/products/123";

// Or use Laravel's url() helper
$httpsLink = url('/products/123');
```

### Sharing Deep Links

Share deep links via the native share sheet:

```php
use Native\Mobile\Facades\Share;

// Share a deep link
$host = config('nativephp.deeplink_host');
Share::share(
    'Check out this product!',
    '',
    "https://{$host}/products/123"
);
```

## Testing Deep Links

### Testing in Development

**iOS Simulator:**
```bash
# Test URL scheme
xcrun simctl openurl booted myapp://home

# Test HTTPS (won't open app in simulator without proper setup)
xcrun simctl openurl booted https://example.com/home
```

**Android Emulator:**
```bash
# Test URL scheme
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "myapp://home"

# Test HTTPS
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://example.com/home"
```

### Testing on Physical Devices

1. Send yourself an email or message with the deep link
2. Tap the link in the email/message
3. Verify the app opens and handles the link correctly

### Testing HTTPS Deep Links

HTTPS deep links require:
- App installed from App Store/Play Store (or signed with release certificate)
- Domain verification files properly configured
- Domain accessible over HTTPS

**Verify iOS Universal Links:**
```bash
# Check if your domain is configured correctly
curl https://example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
```

**Verify Android App Links:**
```bash
# Check if your domain is configured correctly
curl https://example.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### URL scheme deep links not working

1. Verify `NATIVEPHP_DEEPLINK_SCHEME` is set in `.env`
2. Run `php artisan native:install --force`
3. Rebuild and reinstall the app
4. Test with the correct URL format: `scheme://path`

### HTTPS deep links not opening app

1. Verify domain verification files are accessible:
   - `https://example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
   - `https://example.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
2. Ensure files are served over HTTPS with no redirects
3. Verify app is signed with release certificate or installed from store
4. Check Team ID and bundle identifier (iOS) or package name and certificate fingerprint (Android)

### NFC tags not opening app

1. Ensure NFC is enabled on the device
2. Verify the NFC tag contains a valid URL that matches your configured domain
3. Test the URL in a browser first to ensure it works
4. Verify domain verification files are properly configured

### Deep link routes not found

1. Verify routes are defined in `routes/web.php`
2. Check that route parameters match the URL structure
3. Test the route directly in your app first
4. Clear Laravel route cache: `php artisan route:clear`
