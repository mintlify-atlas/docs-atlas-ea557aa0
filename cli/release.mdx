title: native:release
description: Bump the version number in .env file
---

Increments your application's version number according to semantic versioning principles.

## Syntax

```bash
php artisan native:release {type}
```

## Arguments

### type

The type of version bump. Required.

- `patch` - Bug fixes and minor changes (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- `minor` - New features, backward compatible (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- `major` - Breaking changes (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

## Examples

### Patch release (bug fixes)

```bash
php artisan native:release patch
```

Bumps version from `1.2.3` to `1.2.4`

### Minor release (new features)

```bash
php artisan native:release minor
```

Bumps version from `1.2.3` to `1.3.0`

### Major release (breaking changes)

```bash
php artisan native:release major
```

Bumps version from `1.2.3` to `2.0.0`

## What it does

1. **Reads current version**: Gets `NATIVEPHP_APP_VERSION` from your `.env` file
2. **Calculates new version**: Increments based on the release type
3. **Updates .env**: Writes the new version to `NATIVEPHP_APP_VERSION`
4. **Displays result**: Shows the version change

## Version format

Versions follow semantic versioning (SemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible functionality
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

## Environment variable

The command updates `NATIVEPHP_APP_VERSION` in your `.env` file:

```env
NATIVEPHP_APP_VERSION=1.2.3
```

This value is used when building your mobile app and appears in the app's About screen and store listings.

## Build numbers

Note that version name (e.g., "1.2.3") is different from version code (build number):

- **Version name**: User-facing version string (`NATIVEPHP_APP_VERSION`)
- **Version code**: Integer build number (`NATIVEPHP_APP_VERSION_CODE`)

Use `native:check-build-number` to manage version codes.
