Initializes your Laravel application with NativePHP Mobile by installing platform-specific resources and configuring your development environment.

## Syntax

```bash
php artisan native:install [platform] [options]
```

## Arguments

### platform

The platform to install. Optional.

- `android` - Install Android resources only
- `ios` - Install iOS resources only (macOS required)
- `both` - Install both platforms

If not specified, you'll be prompted to choose (on macOS) or Android will be installed automatically (on Windows/Linux).

## Options

### --force, -F, --fresh

Overwrite existing files and directories.

```bash
php artisan native:install --force
```

### --with-icu

Include ICU (International Components for Unicode) support for Android. Adds approximately 30MB to the final app size.

```bash
php artisan native:install android --with-icu
```

### --without-icu

Explicitly exclude ICU support for Android.

```bash
php artisan native:install android --without-icu
```

### --skip-php

Do not download the PHP binaries during installation.

```bash
php artisan native:install --skip-php
```

## Examples

### Install both platforms (macOS only)

```bash
php artisan native:install both
```

### Install Android only with ICU support

```bash
php artisan native:install android --with-icu
```

### Reinstall iOS, overwriting existing files

```bash
php artisan native:install ios --force
```

### Quick install with defaults

```bash
php artisan native:install
```

## What it does

1. **Prompts for App ID**: If `NATIVEPHP_APP_ID` is not set in your `.env` file, you'll be asked to provide a bundle identifier (e.g., `com.example.myapp`)
2. **Creates directories**: Sets up `nativephp/` directory structure in your project
3. **Downloads resources**: Installs platform-specific build tools and PHP binaries
4. **Publishes assets**: Copies templates and configuration files
5. **Configures project**: Sets up Android Studio/Xcode project files
6. **Creates CLI wrapper**: Adds the `native` executable to your project root

## Platform requirements
