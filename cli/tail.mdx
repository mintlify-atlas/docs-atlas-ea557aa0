title: native:tail
description: Tail Laravel logs from the Android app
---

Streams Laravel application logs in real-time from a running Android application.

## Syntax

```bash
php artisan native:tail
```

## What it does

1. Connects to running Android app via `adb`
2. Tails the Laravel log file from the app's storage
3. Displays log entries in real-time
4. Press Ctrl+C to stop

## Examples

### Tail logs from running app

```bash
php artisan native:tail
```

Output:
```
Tailing Android logs for app: com.example.myapp
Press Ctrl+C to stop...

[2024-02-28 10:30:15] local.INFO: User logged in
[2024-02-28 10:30:22] local.DEBUG: Processing order #123
[2024-02-28 10:30:25] local.ERROR: Payment failed: Connection timeout
```

## Requirements

### ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

Must be installed and in PATH:

```bash
# Check if installed
adb version

# macOS
brew install android-platform-tools

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install android-tools-adb

# Windows - comes with Android Studio
```

### Running Android app

The app must be:
- Installed on connected device/emulator
- Currently running
- Built with debuggable flag enabled

### App ID

`NATIVEPHP_APP_ID` must be set in `.env`:

```env
NATIVEPHP_APP_ID=com.example.myapp
```

## How it works

Uses `adb shell run-as` to access the app's private storage:

```bash
adb shell run-as com.example.myapp \
  tail -f app_storage/persisted_data/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

This reads from Laravel's standard log location within the app's sandboxed filesystem.

## Common workflows

### Run and monitor logs

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run the app
php artisan native:run android

# Terminal 2: Tail logs
php artisan native:tail
```

### Debug with watch and logs

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run with watch
php artisan native:run android --watch

# Terminal 2: Tail logs
php artisan native:tail

# Terminal 3: Edit code
vim app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php
```

Now you see:
- Code changes (Terminal 1)
- Log output (Terminal 2)
- Hot reload updates

### Filter logs

Pipe to grep for specific messages:

```bash
php artisan native:tail | grep ERROR
php artisan native:tail | grep "User logged"
```

## Logging best practices

Use Laravel's logging in your mobile app:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

// Different log levels
Log::debug('Debugging information');
Log::info('User action', ['user_id' => 123]);
Log::warning('Something unusual happened');
Log::error('An error occurred', ['exception' => $e]);
```

### Add context

Include useful context:

```php
Log::info('API request', [
    'endpoint' => $url,
    'method' => 'POST',
    'duration' => $duration,
    'response_code' => $response->status(),
]);
```

### Performance logging

```php
$start = microtime(true);

// Your code here

$duration = microtime(true) - $start;
Log::debug('Operation completed', [
    'operation' => 'process_payment',
    'duration_ms' => round($duration * 1000, 2),
]);
```

## Troubleshooting

### "NATIVEPHP_APP_ID is not set"

Add to `.env`:

```env
NATIVEPHP_APP_ID=com.example.myapp
```

### "adb: command not found"

Install Android platform tools:

```bash
# macOS
brew install android-platform-tools

# Or add to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools
```

### "device offline" or "no devices"

Check device connection:

```bash
adb devices
```

Should show:
```
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device
```

If offline:

```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices
```

### "run-as: package not debuggable"

App must be built with debug flag. Use:

```bash
php artisan native:run android --build=debug
```

Release builds are not debuggable.

### No log output

Check:
1. App is running: `adb shell ps | grep your.app.id`
2. Log file exists: Trigger an action that logs
3. Log level: Check `config/logging.php` level

### Alternative: Use Logcat

For system-level logs:

```bash
adb logcat | grep "your.app.id"
```

This shows all Android system logs, not just Laravel logs.

## iOS equivalent

For iOS, use Xcode Console:

1. Run app with Xcode or `native:run ios`
2. Open Xcode
3. Window > Devices and Simulators
4. Select your device/simulator
5. Click "Open Console" button
6. Filter by app name

Or use command line:

```bash
# iOS Simulator
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'processImagePath contains "YourApp"'

# Physical device (requires macOS)
log stream --device --predicate 'processImagePath contains "YourApp"'
```
