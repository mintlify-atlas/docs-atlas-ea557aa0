title: native:watch
description: Watch for file changes and sync to running mobile app
---

Enables hot reloading for mobile app development by watching your Laravel application files and automatically syncing changes to a running app.

## Syntax

```bash
php artisan native:watch [platform] [target] [options]
```

## Arguments

### platform

Platform to watch. Optional.

- `android` or `a` - Watch Android app
- `ios` or `i` - Watch iOS app

If not specified, you'll be prompted to choose.

### target

The device/simulator UDID to watch. Optional.

For iOS, specifies which simulator to sync changes to.

## Options

### --ios

Target iOS platform (shorthand for `platform=ios`).

```bash
php artisan native:watch --ios
```

### --android

Target Android platform (shorthand for `platform=android`).

```bash
php artisan native:watch --android
```

## Examples

### Watch Android app

```bash
php artisan native:watch android
```

### Watch iOS app on specific simulator

```bash
php artisan native:watch ios SIMULATOR-UDID
```

### Watch using shorthand flags

```bash
php artisan native:watch --ios
```

## Requirements

### Watchman

This command requires Facebook's Watchman file watcher:

**macOS**
```bash
brew install watchman
```

**Linux**
```bash
# See https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install
```

**Windows**
```bash
choco install watchman
```

## What it does

1. **Checks dependencies**: Verifies Watchman is installed
2. **Starts file watcher**: Monitors your Laravel application directory
3. **Detects changes**: Watches for file modifications, additions, deletions
4. **Syncs to device**: Pushes changes to the running mobile app
5. **Reloads app**: Triggers automatic reload in the mobile app

## How it works

### Android

- Uses `adb push` to sync files to the device
- Monitors `app/`, `config/`, `resources/`, `routes/` directories
- Triggers app reload via intent broadcast

### iOS

- Uses iOS Simulator's file sharing to sync files
- Monitors same directories as Android
- Triggers app reload via URL scheme

## Watched directories

By default, watches:

- `app/` - Application code
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `resources/` - Views, assets
- `routes/` - Route definitions
- `public/` - Public assets

Changes to `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, and `storage/` are ignored.

## Workflow

Typical development workflow with watch:

1. Start the app with watch enabled:
   ```bash
   php artisan native:run android --watch
   ```

2. Or start watch separately while app is running:
   ```bash
   php artisan native:watch android
   ```

3. Edit your code in your IDE
4. Save the file
5. Changes automatically sync and app reloads
6. See changes in seconds!

## Performance tips

- **Frontend assets**: Use Vite's dev server for faster CSS/JS updates
- **Large files**: Exclude from watch if not needed
- **Multiple devices**: Run separate watch processes for each

## Troubleshooting

### Watchman not found

```bash
# Install watchman
brew install watchman  # macOS
```

### Changes not syncing

1. Check device is connected: `adb devices` (Android)
2. Verify app is running
3. Check Watchman is running: `watchman watch-list`
4. Restart watch command

### Slow syncing

- Check network connection (iOS Simulator)
- Reduce number of watched files
- Clear Watchman cache: `watchman watch-del-all`

## Alternative: Run with --watch

You can also enable watch mode when running the app:

```bash
php artisan native:run android --watch
```

This combines `native:run` and `native:watch` in a single command.
