## Welcome to NativePHP Mobile

NativePHP Mobile enables you to build native iOS and Android applications using PHP and Laravel. Write your mobile apps with the same tools and framework you already know, without needing to learn Swift, Kotlin, or React Native.

## How it works

NativePHP Mobile embeds a PHP runtime directly inside your mobile app. Your Laravel application runs natively on the device, rendering views through a WebView while accessing native device features through a simple PHP API.

```php
use Native\Mobile\Facades\Camera;
use Native\Mobile\Facades\Geolocation;
use Native\Mobile\Facades\Haptics;

// Take a photo
$photo = Camera::getPhoto();

// Get current location
$location = Geolocation::getCurrentPosition(fineAccuracy: true);

// Provide haptic feedback
Haptics::vibrate();
```

## What you can build

NativePHP Mobile is perfect for:

- **Business applications** - Internal tools, dashboards, and admin panels
- **E-commerce apps** - Shopping experiences with native features

- **Productivity tools** - Task managers, note-taking, and utilities
- **Location-based apps** - Services that leverage GPS and maps
- **Camera-enabled apps** - Photo capture, QR scanning, and image processing

## Platform detection with Blade directives

NativePHP provides convenient Blade directives to conditionally render content:

```blade
@mobile
    <p>This content only appears in the mobile app</p>
@endmobile

@web
    <p>This content only appears in the web browser</p>
@endweb

@ios
    <p>iOS-specific content</p>
@endios

@android
    <p>Android-specific content</p>
@endangroid
```

## Example: Simple mobile app

Here's a taste of what building with NativePHP Mobile looks like:

```php
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

Route::post('/capture', function () {
    $photo = Camera::getPhoto();
    
    // Save the photo
    Storage::put('photos/' . $photo['name'], base64_decode($photo['base64']));
    
    Haptics::vibrate();
    
    return back()->with('success', 'Photo captured!');
});
```

```blade
{{-- resources/views/welcome.blade.php --}}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My NativePHP App</title>
    @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to NativePHP Mobile</h1>
    
    @mobile
        <form action="/capture" method="POST">
            @csrf
            <button type="submit">Take Photo</button>
        </form>
    @endmobile
    
    @web
        <p>Please open this app on a mobile device</p>
    @endweb
</body>
</html>
```
